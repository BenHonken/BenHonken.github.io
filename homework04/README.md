# Ben Honken - Trivia

## Description

This is a Breaking Bad trivia game by Ben Honken.  It demonstrates ability to manipulate the DOM.  

## Usage

You can use this to test your Breaking Bad knowledge.

## Credits

So far it's all me.  I'll update this if and when that changes.

## Known Issues

The second or third high score entry tends to break the list.  I'm not sure why.

Leaving during the middle of the quiz may have unintended consequences with the timer.

The layout of the buttons could be cleaned up to make it look and feel more consistent.
