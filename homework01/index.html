            <p>I am developing my skills as a programmer, and this is my portfolio page.  I have always been fascinated by computers, and the first time I made Python print &#8220Hello World!&#8221 I was hooked!  I enjoy logic and problem solving, and I have made some great little programs to save myself time in my own business.</p>
            <p>I live in Burnsville with my wife, son, and dog.  I currently work as a tutor and manage my own tutoring business.  While a secondary goal of mine is to better manage my own website, I am primarily aiming for employment in the field of programming.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!  Check out my portfolio and feel free to swing by the contact section to drop me a line!</p>
