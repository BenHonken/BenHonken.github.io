# Ben Honken - Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator by Ben Honken.  Clicking the generate button will allow the user to create a password based on the criteria provided by the user.  It can contain any combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  The password is then displayed in the text box.  The copy to clipboard button will allow you to easily copy the text.  

## Usage

You can use this to generate random strings of characters to use as passwords.  

## Credits

So far it's all me.  I'll update this if and when that changes.
